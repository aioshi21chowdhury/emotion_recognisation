🚀 Exploring Deep Learning through Practice! 🤖

After diving deep into the world of deep learning, I decided to put my knowledge to the test with a minor project! 🎯

💡 Project: Emotion Classification (Binary) In this project, I built a simple yet effective model to classify facial emotions into two categories: happy 😊 and sad 😞.

🔍 What I Learned:

The importance of preprocessing and data splitting
Building and training a CNN model for image classification
Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
💪 This hands-on experience was a great way to solidify my understanding and sharpen my skills in deep learning!

Next up: More projects and learning new techniques! 🌟
